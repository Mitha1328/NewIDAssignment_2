# IDAssignment2
This is ID assignment 2 for my Harry Potter website
This website will showcase the interesting world and fandom of Harry Potter.
### Books
The first Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Philosopherâ€™s Stone, was published by Bloomsbury in 1997 to immediate popular and critical acclaim. Six further best-selling books, three companion books, a playscript and two screenplays have since followed. The Harry Potter books have been translated into over 80 languages, won multiple awards, and sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling book series in history



# Design Process
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

# Features
## Existing Features
1. Index.html - This page of the website is the main landing page of the website. Where it showcases the filming backstory of the movies.
   * A Map feature where it show the loaction of the filming areas.
   * Fun Facts about the set of the Movie.

2. Login.html - The Login Page I created is linked to the spell.html. where it is stimulated as if the student is logging in this website to take a look at his or her discovered spells and notes on how to cast the spells.

3. Notebook.html - This page is a front end, non data saving, To-Do List kind of page. Where to user can input whatever they need To-Do it will be there and they can play around with the inputs **Until they refresh the page**.

4. Search_charcter.html - This Page will allow the user to search up on the character who are present in both the book and movie series.

5. Spells.html - This page showcases how to perform certain spells, the movement of the "Wands" and defentions and names for more complicated spells, charms, curses and jinxes.
   * SVG animation for the motion of the wands.
   * Card Deck feature where each of the spells are on cards and there is slight animation when the mouse is scrolled over.
## Features Left to Implement
- A feature I wanted to implement is a gamification feature where the user are role playing as a new student to the website and the game will sort them to their new "Houses" just like the Story Book or the Movie. But I could not implement them as I kept getting numerouse bugs for the game and the animation of the "Sorting Hat"

- I still need to implement further numbers of spells to complete the total spells used from the Harry Potter Franchise. I have commented them out in the spells section. This will act as a furthur update to the website in the future.
# Technologies Used
## Java Script
I have learnt that javascript can make the whole website more interectable and workable.
Hence I implemented the script function for almost all of the Html files.

## Login Page
The Login Page I created is linked to the spell.html. where it is stimulated as if the student is logging in this website to take a look at his or her discovered spells and notes on how to cast the spells.

## Responsive Web
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

## Interesting Bugs
* In the spells section, I tried to use java script to code to make sure I have used the API of spells I found out from online. But due to the reason the API was in github format the code got confused and did not fully execute the JS file.

I tried to copy the json file from the public github repositary and create it from scratch but it did not work also.
I then didnt want to spend much time on this and went ahead to create just normal text lists where i just fed in the texts to the card deck function in the spells.html file.
