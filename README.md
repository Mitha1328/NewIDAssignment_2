# IDAssignment2
This is the new ID assignment for my Harry Potter website

spells.json (File)
This file is created because I could not find a appropriate API that has the collection of Spells from Harry potter. Hence copy pasted
Here is the reference to the original codeing
- https://github.com/bukinoshita/harry-potter-spells/blob/master/spells.json

API link to the chracters and their charcteristics

# Notes
This will be the assignment's Halfway submission
I still need to work on consolidateing each of the page's stylesheets and javascripts into one common css and js file.
I will change some of the pictures on the index.html

Once consulting with my module teacher. I will also implement reading aloud system.
Not to forget i will be doing a new page for the spells search up.
# Minor Note
Please do note that I am submitting a day early as I will be busy with other outside work /activities in the weekends.
