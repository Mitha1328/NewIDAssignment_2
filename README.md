# IDAssignment2
This is ID assignment 2 for my Harry Potter website
This website will showcase the interesting world and fandom of Harry Potter.
### Books
The first Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Philosopherâ€™s Stone, was published by Bloomsbury in 1997 to immediate popular and critical acclaim. Six further best-selling books, three companion books, a playscript and two screenplays have since followed. The Harry Potter books have been translated into over 80 languages, won multiple awards, and sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling book series in history

# Design Process
This Website is for the fans of Harry Potter.
Where despite people reading the books or seeing the movie. There are numerourse things that are still a mystery in this fandom. People who see themselves as a student in the hogwarts school for witches and wizarding can come to this website and reference the spell book tab for new spells to learn.

Harry Potter is based of the olden days. Early 2000s and late 1990s. But I wanted to mix the rich oldness of the storyline with the current studying methods we as students are using.
According to the Harry Potter books, students in the story buys physical books and writes physical notes to get through their course of wizarding and witchcraft. But in this website, "Students" or users can look back at the set of easily availables spells and other general things related to the Fandom.

# Features
## Existing Features
1. Index.html - This page of the website is the main landing page of the website. Where it showcases the filming backstory of the movies.
   * A Map feature where it show the loaction of the filming areas.
   * Fun Facts about the set of the Movie.

2. Login.html - The Login Page I created is linked to the spell.html. where it is stimulated as if the student is logging in this website to take a look at his or her discovered spells and notes on how to cast the spells.

3. Notebook.html - This page is a front end, non data saving, To-Do List kind of page. Where to user can input whatever they need To-Do it will be there and they can play around with the inputs **Until they refresh the page**.

4. Search_charcter.html - This Page will allow the user to search up on the character who are present in both the book and movie series.

5. Spells.html - This page showcases how to perform certain spells, the movement of the "Wands" and defentions and names for more complicated spells, charms, curses and jinxes.
   * SVG animation for the motion of the wands.
   * Card Deck feature where each of the spells are on cards and there is slight animation when the mouse is scrolled over.
## Features Left to Implement
- A feature I wanted to implement is a gamification feature where the user are role playing as a new student to the website and the game will sort them to their new "Houses" just like the Story Book or the Movie. But I could not implement them as I kept getting numerouse bugs for the game and the animation of the "Sorting Hat"

- I still need to implement further numbers of spells to complete the total spells used from the Harry Potter Franchise. I have commented them out in the spells section. This will act as a furthur update to the website in the future.
# Technologies Used
## Java Script
I have learnt that javascript can make the whole website more interectable and workable.
Hence I implemented the script function for almost all of the Html files.

## Login Page
The Login Page I created is linked to the spell.html. where it is stimulated as if the student is logging in this website to take a look at his or her discovered spells and notes on how to cast the spells.

## Responsive Web
- This website will resize itself at 860px
- Most of the pages i have coded for the resizeing but the rest such as search-character file will automatically resize due to the fact that it is in the form of flex box

## Interesting Bugs
* In the spells section, I tried to use java script to code to make sure I have used the API of spells I found out from online. But due to the reason the API was in github format the code got confused and did not fully execute the JS file.

I tried to copy the json file from the public github repositary and create it from scratch but it did not work also.
I then didnt want to spend much time on this and went ahead to create just normal text lists where i just fed in the texts to the card deck function in the spells.html file.

The spells.html file is running into many bugs. This I have inserted the style sheet in the main head itself, instead of linking it.
